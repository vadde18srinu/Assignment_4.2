1. x <- c('data.science.in.R', 'machine.learning.in.R')
Perform the below string Operation:
  . Replace the period character "." within each string with another character i.e. "-" minus sign.

x <- c("-data.science.in.R", "-machine.learning.in.R")
x


2. x <- c('data.science.in.R','machine.learning.in.R')
Perform the below String Operation:
  . Append again with "-" minus sign character at the start of the each string and finally concatenate all the string within the vector to form a final single string and assigning it the object.

x <- c("-","data.science.in.R","-","machine.learning.in.R")
x
